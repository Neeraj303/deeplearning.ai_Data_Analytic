**Q1**: What is the margin of error for the 95% confidence interval of the price mean? Round the solution to the first two decimal places (e.g. 221.43).  
- **Answer**: 110.3

**Q2**: Based on the confidence interval for the total sample of diamonds, what can you conclude about the average diamond price in the market?  
- [x] You can be 95% confident that the true average diamond price in the market is between the lower and upper bound values.  
- [ ] The average diamond price for all retailers is exactly the x̄ value.  
- [ ] 95% of all diamonds in the market cost between the lower and upper bound values.  
- [ ] The margin of error suggests that the true mean diamond price could be any value above the upper bound value.  

**Q3**: Your stakeholder, the jeweler, saw the results and asked if you can be more than 95% confident in the estimates. Which two statements below would be true if you were to create a 99% confidence interval?  
- [x] The center of both intervals would be the same.  
- [x] The 99% confidence interval would be wider than the 95% confidence interval.  
- [ ] You would need more samples to achieve a 99% confidence level.  
- [ ] The margin of error would be the same for both confidence intervals.  

**Q4**: The jeweler asks whether the average price of premium cut diamonds is significantly higher than the overall average. Based on the confidence intervals, which of the following can best support your response?  
- [x] The confidence interval for premium diamonds is entirely above the total sample confidence interval, suggesting premium diamonds have a significantly higher average price.  
- [ ] The confidence intervals for premium diamonds and total sample overlap, so you cannot determine whether premium diamonds are priced higher.  
- [ ] Since the mean price of premium cut diamonds is higher than the total sample mean, you can conclude premium diamonds are more expensive.  
- [ ] You cannot draw any conclusions due to the unknown confidence level of the intervals.  

**Q5**: A customer claims that the average price of fair cut diamonds is $2,000. Based on the confidence interval, which of the following can best support your response?  
- [x] The confidence interval for fair cut diamonds does not include $2,000, suggesting the true average price is likely much higher.  
- [ ] Since the sample mean for fair cut diamonds is $4,333.6, you can assume that $2,000 is a reasonable estimate.  
- [ ] The confidence interval suggests that exactly 95% of fair cut diamonds cost between $3,803.7 and $4,863.5.  
- [ ] You cannot determine whether $2,000 is reasonable without knowing the interquartile range.  

**Q6**: Compare the 95% confidence interval for the mean price of diamonds with ‘Premium’ and ‘Fair’ cuts. Which of the following statements is correct?  
- [x] While the standard deviation for the price of ‘Premium’ cut diamonds is bigger, the margin of error is more than two times smaller due to the number of samples.  
- [ ] From the confidence intervals it is clear the mean price for each category is different.  
- [ ] From the confidence intervals it is clear the true mean price for each category is the same.  
- [ ] The difference between the margins of error is inversely proportional to the number of samples in each category.  

**Q7**: Write down the lower limit of the 90% confidence interval of the proportion of ‘Ideal’ or ‘Premium’ cut diamonds (Exercise 2). Round to the first 2 decimal places.  
- **Answer**: 0.65

**Q8**: Why is the margin of error for premium or ideal diamonds larger than the margin of error for fair diamonds?  
- [x] The proportion estimate (p̂) for premium or ideal diamonds is closer to 0.5.  
- [ ] The z-score for premium or ideal diamonds is higher.  
- [ ] The sample size (n) for fair diamonds is larger.  
- [ ] The standard deviation for premium or ideal diamonds is smaller.  

**Q9**: The jeweler asks whether at least 65% of the diamonds in the new shipment will be premium or ideal cut. Based on the confidence interval, which of the following will support your response?  
- [x] The confidence interval for the proportion of premium or ideal diamonds includes 0.65, so it is reasonable to expect that at least 65% of the shipment will be premium or ideal cut.  
- [ ] The sample proportion is greater than 0.65, so you can guarantee that at least 65% of the shipment will be premium or ideal cut.  
- [ ] Since 0.65 is below the upper bound of the confidence interval, it is unlikely that at least 65% of the shipment will be premium or ideal cut.  
- [ ] The confidence interval suggests that exactly 90% of the shipment will be premium or ideal cut.  

**Q10**: A customer asks whether fewer than 3% of the diamonds in the shipment are fair cut. Based on the confidence interval, what can you conclude?  
- [x] The confidence interval for fair cut diamonds includes 3%, so you cannot confidently say that fewer than 3% of the diamonds are fair cut.  
- [ ] Since the sample proportion for fair cut diamonds is 2.94%, you can conclude that fewer than 3% of all diamonds are fair cut.  
- [ ] The confidence interval proves that at most 2.55% of all diamonds are fair cut.  
- [ ] The margin of error suggests that the proportion of fair cut diamonds could be any value above 3.33%.
