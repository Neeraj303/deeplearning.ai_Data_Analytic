**Q2**: Which two of the following options are types of biases that can occur when collecting your sample? (Select all that apply)  
- [ ] Selection bias  
- [x] Nonresponse bias  
- [x] Measurement bias  
- [ ] Analysis bias  

**Q3**: When conducting a segmentation analysis, why is it important to use the same set of analyses across all the different segments?  
- [x] To ensure consistency and comparability of results across segments.  
- [ ] To reduce the amount of data you need to analyze.  
- [ ] To increase the complexity of the analysis.  

**Q4**: You're examining the relationship between a turtle's size and how fast it completes a turtle race. You calculated a negative Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r). What does this value indicate about the relationship between the two features?  
- [x] As one feature increases, the other tends to decrease.  
- [ ] As one feature increases, the other also increases.  
- [ ] There is no relationship between the features.  
- [ ] There is a nonlinear relationship between the two features.  

**Q5**: Which four of the following options are non-probabilistic sampling methods? (Select all that apply)  
- [x] Convenience sampling  
- [x] Quota sampling  
- [x] Judgmental sampling  
- [x] Snowball sampling  
- [ ] Simple random sampling  

**Q6**: According to the lectures, which step must come first when defining the population of interest for your analysis?  
- [x] Use your hypothesis or research question to better understand the problem.  
- [ ] Consider the practical constraints like accessibility, budget, and time available.  
- [ ] Collect your sample, such as by interviewing participants or locating relevant data.  
- [ ] Determine the generalizability of your sample.  

**Q7**: Which of the following questions about your data can you answer using measures of variability?  
- [x] Are the values in the data clustered together or spread out?  
- [ ] What values are most frequent?  
- [ ] Where is the middle of the data?  
- [ ] Is the distribution symmetrical or does it lean to one side?  

**Q8**: You calculated a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (r) of 0 between two features: the age of a turtle's handler and the turtle's racing speed. What does this value indicate?  
- [x] There is no linear relationship between the features.  
- [ ] There is a perfect positive correlation.  
- [ ] There is a perfect negative correlation.  
- [ ] There is no relationship of any kind – linear or nonlinear – between the features.  

**Q9**: Recall that systematic sampling means starting with a random member of the population, then selecting every nth member after that (such as every 10th member). What is a potential issue with systematic sampling?  
- [x] Periodicity bias, since patterns in the data can cause a systematic deviation from the population.  
- [ ] Expense, since you must survey more people compared with a simple random sample.  
- [ ] Randomness, since the initial member is selected randomly.  
- [ ] Difficulty, since it can be complex to randomly generate the nth member.  

**Q10**: You're examining a dataset of turtle racing times. You plotted the histogram below showing the frequencies of different ranges of times. Which two of the following statements reflect true conclusions about the turtle racing times?  
- [x] The race times are positively skewed.  
- [ ] The race times are negatively skewed.  
- [x] The mean is greater than the median.  
- [ ] The median is greater than the mean.
