### Population and Sampling

ðŸŽ¥ [4 populations and sampling W1 L2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZGsoMZrgN8) 

You always dont have access to the whole population, so you take a sample.  
**Law of Large Number:**  
As the sample size increases, the sample mean gets closer to the population mean.  

ðŸŽ¥ [5 identifying the population W1 L2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DfZC5ldYmWM)  
ðŸŽ¥ [6 probabilistic samples W1 L2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zmlLBC_KnM)  

Sampling methods:  
- Probabilistic: Gives every member of population a known, non-zero change of being selected.
  - Random: Gives every member of the population an equal chance of being selected.
  - Stratified: Population is divided into subgroups, and a random sample is taken from each subgroup.
  - Cluster: Population is divided into clusters, and a random sample of clusters is selected.
  - Systematic: Every nth member of the population is selected, periodicity bias

ðŸŽ¥ [7 non probabilistic samples W1 L2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5H41e5KoGjo)  

- Non Probabilistic: Dont give every member of the population a known, non-zero chance of being selected.
  - Convenience: Easy to access, but not representative, significant bias
  - Judgement: Based on the judgement of the researcher
  - Snowball: Participants refer other participants
  - Quota: Based on a specific characteristic  
  
ðŸŽ¥ [8 types of bias W1 L2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XwZyCGKU-E)

Bias when sample does not represent the population.   
Types of bias:
- Sampling bias: when deciding how to sample
  - Selection bias: Sample is not representative of the population
  - Non-response bias: when some members of the population are less likely to respond
- Measurement bias: when data is collected
  - Instrument bias: when the instrument used to collect data is not accurate
  - Observer bias: when the observer influences the data
- Response bias: when data is collected
- Analysis bias: during insights generation
  - Confirmation bias: when the researcher looks for data that confirms their hypothesis

### Variability and Skewness

ðŸŽ¥ [15 variability range and interquartile range W1 L4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRv5dsXhtx4)  

$$ Range = x_{max} - x_{min} $$
$$ IQR = Q3 - Q1 $$
$$ Q1 = x_{(n+1)/4} $$
$$ Q3 = x_{3(n+1)/4} $$

ðŸŽ¥ [16 variability variance and standard deviation W1 L4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUDd1wHrwTM)  

$$ (Variance) \: S^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} $$
$$ (Sample \: Standard \: Deviation)  \: S = \sqrt{Variance} $$

ðŸŽ¥ [17 skewness W1 L4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQx3WX2bJ20)  

$$ Skewness = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^3}{n \times \sigma^3} $$

**Positive Skew**: Mean > Median, Long tail at right  
**Negative Skew**: Mean < Median, long tail at left

### Correlation

ðŸŽ¥ [22 correlation W1 L5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuoKIzTW4cU)  

$$ (Pearson \: Correlation) \: r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{(n-1) \times \sigma_x \times \sigma_y} $$

ðŸš¨ Pearson Corrleation measures the linear relationship between two features and does not depend on the slope.  

ðŸŽ¥ [23 correlation and causation W1 L5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTHmsdmQ6mk)  

Correlation does not imply causation. **Confounding Variable** controls both dependent and independent variable.

**Q9**: Recall that systematic sampling means starting with a random member of the population, then selecting every nth member after that (such as every 10th member). What is a potential issue with systematic sampling?  
- [x] Periodicity bias, since patterns in the data can cause a systematic deviation from the population.  
- [ ] Expense, since you must survey more people compared with a simple random sample.
